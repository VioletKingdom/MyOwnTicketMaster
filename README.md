# My Own Ticket Master
Java Web Service Development - Event Search and Personalized Event Ticket Recommendation

- Designed and implemented an interactive web page (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/AJAX) for users to search events
and purchase tickets.

- Designed content-based recommendation algorithms to improve personalized business recommendation based
on search history and favorite records.

- Created Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses.

- Used MySQL to store real business data (price, location, category, etc.) and migrated to NoSQL database
(MongoDB) for better scalability.

- Deployed to Amazon EC2 to handle 150 queries per second tested by Apache JMeter.
